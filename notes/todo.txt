=== TO Discuss ===
- is CCA is the right choice for predicting which methylotroph will dominate?
  - do we want an output for Y that is linear combinations of methylotrophs? (yes?)

=== TODO ===
- why do our Xval results suggest 0.15 and R's suggest
  - Could be that the best regularization strength depends on N.
    - Their X-val is 8 fold.  Small held-out sets —> noisy results,
      but the N for each fold is closer to the whole set’s N.
  - Another potential reason for the difference is the normalization.
    - We really need to find out what normalization it is doing by
      looking at the source code.
- hack the R package to show us what the transformation is doing?
  - compare the normalized matrix from StandardScalar to that of R
    - plot value in one against value from other
- why do the CCA projections seem to show < 80 points? (are they all clumped)?
- conservation of genes selected in X-val.
- poster:
  - Show plot of correlation vs sparsity in u, v
  - Show scatter plots of projections (half baked in CCA.py: need axes labels etc)
  - gene names for nonzero weights
- plot CCA of final data with time series?
  - is 8 vars really enough to show a time trend?
- What are the weights?  Are many of them close to zero?
- hack the R source to give us access to the x, z transformations.
- CCA:
  - how to interpret results?
    - what do large weights mean?
- PCA of only the methanotrophy genes?
- add the other data sets into our PCA projections: can we use them at all?
- is our RPKM data really RPKM?  It's all integers, which makes it seem like counts.
- what fraction of reads are unmapped?
  - is Janet's old orange & gray plot from bins or these genomes?
-

=== Still pondering ===
- compositional effects (e.g. fractional abundance)
  - is this ok in ML?
-

=== Done ===
- try R's permute on whole data set w/ new data
  - done.  Suggests 0.567 for penalty_x and penalty_z
- make an F matrix for each category
  - functions to break apart dataframe on unique attributes of a column
  - function to aggregate on gene name given a dataframe
- make heat maps of the organism abundances
  - separate out methanotrophs and methylotrophs by name.
  - lump the others into "other"
