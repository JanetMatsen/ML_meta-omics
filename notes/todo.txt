=== TODO ===
- make an F matrix for each category
  - functions to break apart dataframe on unique attributes of a column
  - function to aggregate on gene name given a dataframe
- make heat maps of the organism abundances
  - separate out methanotrophs and methylotrophs by name.
  - lump the others into "other"
- finalize labels of methanotrophs/methylotrophs
- play with sklearn cross validation
- finalize research interests
  - which methylotrophs are present, and what methanotrophy genes cause it?
    - PCA on pooled methanotrophy gene expression
    - use those PCA components to predict composition of methylotrophs
- start sketching out poster
  - google docs?

=== Done ===


=== Still pondering ===
- compositional effects (e.g. fractional abundance)
  - is this ok in ML?
