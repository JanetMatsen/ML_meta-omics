=== TO Discuss ===
- is CCA is the right choice for predicting which methylotroph will dominate?
  - do we want an output for Y that is linear combinations of methylotrophs? (yes?)

=== TODO ===
- (J) ask about SS in Py & R
- re-do PCA since we dropped hypothetick & unknown
  - save w/ a different filename so we can compare
- add the T/F array --> gives you the names of genes kept
  - actually drop the == 0 ones (keep the != 0 cols)
  - add the names to the CCA .py objet thing
  - run test_single_Xval_set.R
  - if troubleshoot.R works, that's wonderful.
- if standardize=False workes in troubleshoot.R or test_single_Xval_set.R
  (unexpected), update CCA.R, which gets called by Python
- compare the normalized matrix from StandardScalar to that of R
  - plot value in one against value from other
- Re-run cross-val
- is there a way to get out of standard scalar in R?
- plot time series
- increase the iteration threshold more
- don't let R normalize, or at least
- WHAT ARE THE GENES?
- What are the weights?  Are many of them close to zero?
- CCA:
  - how to interpret results?
    - what do large weights mean?
- PCA of only the methanotrophy genes?
- add the other data sets into our PCA projections: can we use them at all?
- is our RPKM data really RPKM?  It's all integers, which makes it seem like counts.
- what fraction of reads are unmapped?
  - is Janet's old orange & gray plot from bins or these genomes?
-

=== Still pondering ===
- compositional effects (e.g. fractional abundance)
  - is this ok in ML?
-

=== Done ===
- make an F matrix for each category
  - functions to break apart dataframe on unique attributes of a column
  - function to aggregate on gene name given a dataframe
- make heat maps of the organism abundances
  - separate out methanotrophs and methylotrophs by name.
  - lump the others into "other"
