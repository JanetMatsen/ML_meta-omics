=== TO Discuss ===
- discuss why CCA is not the right choice for predicting which methylotroph
  will dominate
  - do we want an output for Y that is linear combinations of methylotrophs?
- if X is gene expression, is it ok to apply our methods on Y, which is the
  fraction of (normalized) expression attributed to each organism?
    - they are not numerically independent.

=== TODO ===
- start with a vanilla sparse regression?
  - back to the question of picking what y is. 
- CCA:
  - how sparse are my sparse results?
  - how good is the fit?  What is the magnitude of correlation?
  - does standard-scalar type treatment of expression before CCA make sense?
  - how to interpret results?
    - what do large weights mean?
  - how do you answer what methanotrophy genes predict expression of a
    methylotrophy gene of interest?
  - how do we gauge how predictive the linear combination is?
- PCA of only the methanotrophy genes?
- add the other data sets into our PCA projections: can we use them at all?
- is our RPKM data really RPKM?  It's all integers, which makes it seem like counts.
- finalize labels of methanotrophs/methylotrophs
- play with sklearn cross validation
- finalize research interests
  - which methylotrophs are present, and what methanotrophy genes cause it?
    - PCA on pooled methanotrophy gene expression
    - use those PCA components to predict composition of methylotrophs
- start sketching out poster
  - google docs?

=== Done ===


=== Still pondering ===
- compositional effects (e.g. fractional abundance)
  - is this ok in ML?
-

=== Done ===
- make an F matrix for each category
  - functions to break apart dataframe on unique attributes of a column
  - function to aggregate on gene name given a dataframe
- make heat maps of the organism abundances
  - separate out methanotrophs and methylotrophs by name.
  - lump the others into "other"
