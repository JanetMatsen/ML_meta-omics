- canonical correlation - correlation between two sets; the largest possible
  correlation that can be found between linear combinations
- weights:
  - weights used to create the linear combinations; like regression coefficients
- loadings:
  - within-set loadings. Like loadings in PCA.

- suggested minimum sample size is 10* number of variables

- The method was first introduced by Harold Hotelling in 1936.

- maximizing correlation
  - unlike PCA, which maximizes variance that is extracted.

- can be thought of as dimension reduction
- assumptions:

    - linear relationship between variables (correlation is linear)
    - multivariate normality
    - multiple colinearity (?)
