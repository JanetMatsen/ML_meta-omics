Main points:

- We're biologists! Often have to deal with small N, large d datasets.
- Our research question evolved quite a bit:
	- what is the "y" we want to predict?
	- came to realize interesting biological questions were multivariate
		- what species tend to show up together?
		- how do environmental perturbations affect overall
		  population composition? Can we detect trends of behavior?
		- what genes and/or protein functions are important for
		  determining which species cohabitate?
- Model selection:
	- at first, trying to fit our data into the "predict single output" framework
	- got excited hearing about CCA, since it gave us a way to look at
	  complex relationships in high-dimensional data
	- however, CCA is unstable when N << d, and we had LOTS of features
	- chose to use a sparse CCA implementation (so that we have sufficient power
	  to get decent estimates)
	- filtered data to reduce redundant/noninformative features
		- aggregate on gene name
		- filter out hypothetical/unknown genes
	- cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning (to avoid overfitting)

- Next steps: 
	- how different are the predictive genes across folds?
	- run on all of data with final hyperparameters, and see which genes drive
	  metabolic fn (as evidenced by gene expression) in the other species group
	- observe which types of genes are impt for predicting species composition
