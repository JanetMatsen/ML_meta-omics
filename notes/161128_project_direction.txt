=== Potential Questions ===
- What predicts which methanotroph will dominate?
  - ??
- Given pooled methanotroph gene expression, what predicts which methylotroph will dominate?
  - assign fraction of reads to each species name; calculate fractional abundance
    - are there problems with this metric I am forgetting? 
-
- what gene expression differentiates the dominant methanotrophs?
  - infer the abundances from the read counts.
  - ?? What fraction of the reads were mapped to these isolates?
- predict which methylotroph arises based on methanotrophy
  - based on methanotroph abundance
